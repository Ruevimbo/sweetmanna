    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section class="story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The name <em>“Sweet Manna”</em> comes from the Bible story of manna — the bread from heaven that fed God’s people. 
        Just like that gift, our bakery exists to bring <strong>daily comfort and delight</strong> to everyone who walks 
        through our doors. What began as a small dream has grown into a space where faith meets flavor, and where every 
        recipe carries a piece of the founder’s heart.
